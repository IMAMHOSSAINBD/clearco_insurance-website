            <li class="font-weight-bold">Definition of Tailored Quote</li>
            <br>
            <p>7.1 The definition of the term “Tailored Quote” means any policy or quotation suited to your specific requirement that takes in consideration your individual lifestyle. With the service that we provide we do not act as a broker, agent or third party for any particular insurer at any one time. We have provided you with links to comparison websites, and other various companies, to find you the best possible deal so that you can use our website to have an instant quote from a provider of your own choice and buy online. In any case if would like us to manually fill out any form on your behalf according to your individual specification and circumstances, we can work on finding you a tailored quote, as long as you authorise us and provide us with accurate information. Based on the details given by you, we can provide you a free non-obligatory tailored quote from various companies. With the given information we will manually search into a variety of prospects to find insurance suited to your means. Usually this is a more challenging task, which in turn will save you money and time. We cannot make any alterations to the insurance policy itself but we can endeavour to find the type of policy that fits your requirements. Your tailored quote includes our administration fee, interest and all other charges, but it does not include any charges from insurer or broker that may arise later on if you instruct any amendment or alteration to the policy after setting up, like change of car or change of address. When we provide you with a tailored quote we always process your data and payment information according to the Data Protection Act 1998. <span class="font-weight-bold text-dark">We do not conduct activities as a broker or agent for any specific insurance company. Coherence to Consumer Rights Act 2015 and The General  Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)the client (yourself) is appointing or authorising us to carry out price searching work on your behalf to find you a tailored quotation or renewal comparison from the available market (based on the accuracy of the information you have submitted to us). Clearco Insure Limited does not make any personal recommendations or suggestions or give any financial advice to the suitability of any products to our clients (yourself) as we are not FCA regulated</span></p>
            <br>
            <li class="font-weight-bold">Price delivery</li>
            <br>
            <p>8.1 You should receive the results of your enquiry (Tailored Quote) within 24-48 hours by text (sms) to the mobile number provided and or by email. You will also be contacted by telephone to discuss where you will have the opportunity to learn more about the policy features. However, we are completely reliant on the availability of the third party sites and on the overall performance of the World Wide Web. At certain times Tailored Quotes are not available. You will be advised if this is the case and under these circumstances we will e-mail you to advise when your quote is ready.</p>
            <br>
            <li class="font-weight-bold">What will you have to pay us for our services?</li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>9.1 Full details of any fees for amendments related to your policy that you directly pay to your insurer can be found in your policy documentation. Any other fees will be discussed or advised of before proceeding with the policy. We provide Tailored Quotes for free of charge but if you decide to buy any policy by using Tailored Quote or its reference, it may incur a separate administration fee. When you pay us any administration fee you only pay us for providing you with the Tailored Quote (only when you choose to buy the policy, if you do not buy any policy, it is free) but not for setting up the policy. The administration fee / service fee you will be paying us for manually searching the market for you on your behalf and working as a manual price searching company to find you comparison prices for you. Our fees also include any further assistance we may provide you such as contacting DVLA, Accident Management and so forth. Also for the time spent on each individual customer and their tailored quote. When we deliver you with your tailored quote our administration fee is always included with the price (also never part of the premium). If you give us any false or inaccurate information, it may result in cancellation of your policy and our administration fee will not be refunded. We do not share the administration fee with any insurer and this is not linked with your insurance policy and is non-refundable at any time.</p>
            <li class="font-weight-bold">What are your responsibilities?</li>
            <br>
            <p>10.1 It is your responsibility to answer all questions on the relevant form to the best of your knowledge and authenticity. If you are not sure of any answers, then you should disclose any information you think might be important. If the answers are incorrect, you may have no insurance from inception or additional premiums could be payable, which the insurer reserves the right to collect. Upon purchasing an insurance policy it is your responsibility to check and if necessary amend any details with any broker or insurer who you decide to purchase your policy from. If you fail to do this, this may invalidate the insurance. It is solely your responsibility to read the Terms and Conditions of your policy/product that you are purchasing from your insurer or service provider.</p>
            <br>
            <p>10.2 It is important you understand the Terms and Conditions agreed with us only relate to this website. We strongly make it clear to the client (yourself) any premiums you choose to take out is your responsibility and we will not be monitoring it for you or conduct any regulatory activities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>10.3 The payment you make to the insurance company is for insurance cover only. You must only give consent to pay the insurer/broker, if you agree with insurer’s/broker’s terms and conditions as stated on their website. You pay us a separate service fee for price searching work. If the insurer accepts the payment from your bank card, this fee is non-refundable. We do not take any commission from the insurer and our services are limited to price searching and assisting you to buy your policy only. If the payment does not go through due to incorrect or false information provided to us by you, such as but not limited to undeclared accidents, penalties, bogus No Claims Bonus and not mentioning if you ever had insurance declined or cancelled previously, we reserve the right to charge an admin fee from the amount that you would pay to us, even if we do not manage to find you a quote with the correct information given to us afterwards. If any similar quotation that is generated through our work is bought, the charges for our work may apply depending on circumstances. If the insurer imposes any unfair terms to cancel your policy, depending on the time of cover we may deduct only £50 of the service charge you have paid us and refund you the rest although according to our full terms we are not obliged to do this.</p>
            <br>
            <p>10.4 In terms of legality and data accuracy any information entered on the insurer’s website has been recorded and insurer/broker sends you this via email link or post. It is your responsibility to register yourself online on your insurer’s website and check all documents and print a copy for yourself. If there is any inaccuracy please contacts us within 7 days of buying your policy so we can help you correct any issues as our service charge allows you seven days only for data checking and any change if needed.</p>

            <li class="font-weight-bold">Events of accidents and Claims and Underwriting Exchange (CUE)</li>
            <br>
            <p>11.1 Any driver who has had any accidents (fault or non-fault) or claims (whether claim made or not) in the last 5 years must disclose this information when asked, failing to do so may lead to an increase of the premium or it may invalidate insurance with the possibility of cancellation fees. Insurers or brokers may also check with CUE for the history of any accidents or claims recorded within the CUE database. The Claims and Underwriting Exchange (CUE) is a central database of motor, home and personal injury/industrial illness incidents reported to insurance companies, which may or may not give rise to a claim.</p>
            <br>
            <li class="font-weight-bold">Claims & Underwriting Exchange Register</li>
            <br>
            <p>12.1 Insurers pass information to the Claims and Underwriting Exchange Register run by Insurance Database Services Limited (IDS Ltd), the Hunter Database, run by MCL Software Ltd and the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register, run by the Association of British Insurers (ABI) to help the insurer to check the information provided and also to prevent fraudulent claims. When the insurer deals with your request for insurance, the insurer may search these Registers and any other relevant registers. Under the conditions of your policy, you must tell the insurer about any incident (such as an accident or theft) regardless of blame and whether a claim has been made or not. When you tell the insurer about an incident, the insurer will pass this information to the Registers and to any other relevant registers. You can ask the insurer for more information about this.</p>
            <br>
            <li class="font-weight-bold">Motor convictions, fixed penalty or disqualification and Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA)</li>
            <br>
            <p>13.1 Any driver who has had any motor convictions, fixed penalties or disqualifications in the last 5 years must disclose this information when asked, failing to do so may lead to an increase of the premium or it may invalidate insurance with the possibility of cancellation fees. Insurers or brokers may also check with DVLA for the history of any motor convictions, fixed penalties or disqualifications recorded within the DVLA database. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) is the organisation of the UK Government responsible for maintaining a database of drivers and a database of vehicles in Great Britain.</p>
            <br>
            <li class="font-weight-bold">No claims bonus (NCB) / No claims discount (NCD)</li>
            <br>
            <p>14.1 Proof of No Claims Bonus (NCB) may be required if you take out a policy where a NCB has been applied. It is solely the client’s responsibility to provide the proof of NCB. This proof should be a renewal notice or letter from your previous Insurance Company, which shows the main driver as the policyholder and the NCB earned. A policy schedule is not a good form of proof and may not be accepted. This NCB can only be used on one policy at any one time, and must have been used on a policy within the last 24 months.</p>
            <br>
            <li class="font-weight-bold">Motor Insurance Database</li>
            <br>
            <p>15.1 Your motor insurance policy details will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID), run by the Motor Insurers’ Information Centre (MIIC), sometimes it may take up to 7 days to get your policy details updated on the MID. You can also check information about your own vehicle at www.askmid.com. MID data may be used by the DVLA and DVLNI for the purpose of Electronic Vehicle Licensing and by the Police for the purposes of establishing whether a driver’s use of the vehicle is likely to be covered by a motor insurance policy and/or for preventing and detecting crime. If you are involved in an accident (in the UK or abroad), other UK insurers, the Motor Insurers’ Bureau and MIIC may search the MID to obtain relevant car insurance policy information. Persons pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID. You can find out more about this from the insurer, or at www.miic.org.uk</p>
            <br>
            <li class="font-weight-bold">Terms of risk and circumstances where the insurer is unable to provide a quote</li>
            <br>
            <p>16.1 All providers specialise in dealing with different levels of risks and they do not quote on risks that fall outside their target customers. The more “high risk” or “non-standard” your risk is classed as by them, the fewer prices you will receive. In some cases, it might not be possible for you obtain a quote at all over the internet. In such cases we may put you in contact with a specialist telephone provider who will approach the insurance underwriters direct and negotiate a special rate on your behalf.</p>
