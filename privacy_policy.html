            <br>
            We shall continue to process this information until the contract between us ends or is terminated by either party under the terms of the contract.</p>
            <br>
            <li class="font-weight-bold">Information we process with your consent</li>
            <br>
            <p>Through certain actions when otherwise there is no contractual relationship between us, such as when you browse our website or ask us to provide you more information about our business, including our products and services, you provide your consent to us to process information that may be personal information.
            <br>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>We may process information on the basis there is a legitimate interest, either to you or to us, of doing so.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Where we process your information on this basis, we do after having given careful consideration to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>whether the same objective could be achieved through other means</li>
                <li>whether processing (or not processing) might cause you harm</li>
                <li>whether you would expect us to process your data, and whether you would, in the round, consider it reasonable to do so</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>record-keeping for the proper and necessary administration of our Clearco Insurance</li>

            <br>
            <br>

            In assessing your application/renewal, the insurer/credit provider may search files made available to the insurer / credit provider by Credit Reference Agencies. Once you authorised us to search in all comparison websites on your behalf based on the information provided by you after agreeing & following our website’s links & forms for Car, Van, Home, Business insurance as well accident / claims details, they (comparison website providers, authorised brokers or underwriters) may keep a record of that search. The insurer / credit provider may also pass to Credit Reference Agency information the insurer / credit provider hold about you and your payment record with the insurer / credit provider. Credit Reference Agencies share information with other organisations, enabling applications for financial products to be assessed or to assist the tracing of debtors, or to prevent fraud. The insurer / credit provider may ask Credit Reference Agencies to provide a credit scoring computation. Credit scoring uses a number of factors to work out risks involved in any application.

            <p>What is Spam? Spam is unsolicited e-mail, often of a commercial nature, sent indiscriminately to multiple mailing lists, individuals, or news groups. In short, spam is “junk e-mail.” As defined by H.R. 3113 and reported by the Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Trade, and Consumer Protection, unsolicited e-mail refers to any electronic message that:advertises a product or service for profit is sent for other commercial purposes is sent to a recipient with whom the initiator does not have an existing business relationship or invites the recipient to view content on an internet website that is operated for a commercial purpose. Clearco Insure Ltd recognises an e-mail as “spam” if: the recipient is unable to easily unsubscribe from the e-mail list the transmission contains invalid or forged headers invalid or non-existent domain name or other means of deceptive addressing, or in the opinion of the recipient the transmission and reception of the message appears to give a disproportionate benefit to the sender </p>
